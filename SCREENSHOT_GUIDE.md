## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This:
- Screenshot of failed workflows (must be all green)
- Screenshot without URLs visible in browser
- kubectl output without EXTERNAL-IPs (wait for LoadBalancers)
- ECR without images (workflows must run first)
- Application not loading (check service URLs)

### ✅ Do This:
- Wait for all workflows to succeed before screenshots
- Ensure URLs in browser match kubectl output
- Show complete workflow run details
- Include all 11 screenshots in submission

---

## 🚀 Quick Verification Before Submission

Run this checklist:

```bash
# 1. Check all workflows passed
# Go to https://github.com/Hzzxjj/prj4-upd/actions

# 2. Check services are running
kubectl get svc -n default

# 3. Test frontend
curl http://[frontend-EXTERNAL-IP]

# 4. Test backend
curl http://[backend-EXTERNAL-IP]/movies

# 5. Check ECR images
aws ecr list-images --repository-name frontend --region us-east-1
aws ecr list-images --repository-name backend --region us-east-1
```

If all commands succeed, you're ready to take screenshots! ✅
